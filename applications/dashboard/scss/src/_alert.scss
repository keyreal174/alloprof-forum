// Alerts
//
// Alerts are warning/info/danger/success messages that generally appear at the top of a page. Alerts use twbs's scss.

// Styleguide 16.

// Alerts
//
// Alerts come in four different flavours.
//
// .alert-info - Inform the user about something. It's not going to break anything if they don't see this, but it's good to know.
// .alert-warning - Warn the user about something. It's best that they heed this advice if they want everything to run smoothly.
// .alert-danger - Alert the user of a failure or if they're about to do something that has serious consequences.
// .alert-success - Let the user know that what they've tried to do has been successful.
//
// Markup:
// <div class="alert {{modifier_class}} padded">
//   This is an alert message. Take note ye all.
// </div>
