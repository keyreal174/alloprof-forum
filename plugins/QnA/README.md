# Q&A

Users may designate a discussion as a Question and then officially accept one or more of the comments as the answer.

### Notes:

- You can set  `Plugins.QnA.UseBigButtons = true` in config to separate "New Discussion" and "Ask Question" into "separate" forms each with own big button in Panel.

- This addon has a feature flag `Feature.DiscussionQnATag.Enabled`  that when enabled displays a Q&A meta tag in the discussion header.
